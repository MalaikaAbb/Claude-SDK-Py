# Fixed Schema A2UI

> Pre-defined A2UI schema with dynamic data. The fastest approach, with no LLM schema generation needed.


<!-- interactive demo: a2ui-fixed-schema -->


In the fixed-schema approach, you design the UI schema once (by hand,
or using the [A2UI Composer](https://a2ui-composer.ag-ui.com/)) and
keep it on the agent side. The agent tool only provides the *data*;
the surface appears instantly when the tool returns because nothing
has to be generated at runtime.

How the schema is *delivered* to the runtime is the only thing that
varies between integrations:

- **Schema-loading** (langgraph-python, langgraph-typescript,
  langgraph-fastapi, llamaindex, crewai-crews, pydantic-ai,
  ms-agent-python, google-adk), the schema is saved as a `.json`
  file next to the agent and loaded once at startup.
- **Schema-inline** (spring-ai, ms-agent-dotnet), the schema is
  declared inline as a typed literal in source. The host language
  doesn't ship a `load_schema` JSON loader, so the structure is
  compiled in directly.
- **LLM-driven** (mastra, strands), the agent runs a secondary LLM
  call to produce the operations container per-request. The catalog
  is still fixed; the schema is generated on demand.

Ask about a flight and the agent renders a fully structured card from a pre-defined schema:

## How it works

1. The schema is made available to the agent, either loaded from a
   JSON file at startup, declared inline, or generated per-request,
   depending on the integration.
2. The agent's `display_flight` tool receives data from the primary LLM
   (origin / destination / airline / price).
3. The tool returns `a2ui.render(...)` with `createSurface` +
   `updateComponents` + `updateDataModel` operations.
4. The A2UI middleware intercepts the tool result and the frontend
   renders the surface using the matching 5-component client catalog
   (Title, Airport, Arrow, AirlineBadge, PriceTag, plus the built-ins).

## Compositional schemas

The example below ships a flight card assembled compositionally from
small sub-components rather than one monolithic `FlightCard`:

```
Card
 └─ Column
     ├─ Title        ("Flight Details")
     ├─ Row          (Airport → Arrow → Airport)
     ├─ Row          (AirlineBadge · PriceTag)
     └─ Button       (Book)
```

That tree lives backend-side, as a JSON file, an inline literal, or
a per-request LLM output, depending on the integration. Components
without data bindings (like `Title` or `Arrow`) carry their value
inline; components bound to the LLM's data (like `Airport`) reference
fields via JSON Pointer paths such as `{ "path": "/origin" }`. The
A2UI binder resolves those paths *before* the React renderer runs, so
your renderer receives the resolved value and never sees the path — but
the *definition* still has to declare that prop as a literal-or-binding
union, because that union is the only signal the binder has that the
prop is bindable. See [Declare the component
definitions](#declare-the-component-definitions).

## The 5-component custom catalog

The frontend catalog declares just the domain-specific primitives
(Title, Airport, Arrow, AirlineBadge, PriceTag) and merges in
CopilotKit's basic catalog (Card, Column, Row, Text, Button, …) via
`includeBasicCatalog: true`.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install the renderer package

The catalog, definitions and renderers below all import from
`@copilotkit/a2ui-renderer`. It ships separately from
`@copilotkit/react-core`, and the definitions use `zod` for prop schemas:

```npm
npm install @copilotkit/a2ui-renderer zod
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Declare the component definitions

Each component declares its props as a Zod schema. Any prop the schema
binds to the data model — anything that can arrive as
`{ "path": "/origin" }` rather than a literal — **must** be declared as a
union of the literal type and the binding object. That is what the
`DynString` helper below is for, and why `Airport`'s `code` uses it
rather than a plain `z.string()`.

The binder decides whether to resolve a prop by *inspecting its Zod
type*: a union with a `{ path }` member is treated as dynamic and
resolved against the data model, while a plain literal type is treated
as static and passed through untouched. So declaring a bound prop as
`z.string()` does not merely lose type precision — it tells the binder
not to resolve it, and the raw `{ path: "/origin" }` object reaches your
renderer.

<Callout type="warn" title="Plain `z.string()` on a bound prop crashes the render">
  Because the unresolved object reaches the renderer, the first thing
  that renders it as text throws React's
  [error #31](https://react.dev/errors/31):
  `Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {path})`.
  Nothing in that message points at the schema, so it reads as a renderer
  bug rather than a missing union. If you hit it, check the prop's
  declared type first.

  Props that are never bound (`Arrow`, or a `variant` enum) are fine as
  plain types. This applies only to props the schema binds.
</Callout>

Once the union is declared, the binder resolves the path before your
renderer runs, so the renderer still receives a plain string — the union
describes what the *schema* may send, not what the renderer must handle.
`@copilotkit/a2ui-renderer` re-exports A2UI's canonical
`DynamicStringSchema` (plus `DynamicNumberSchema`, `DynamicBooleanSchema`
and the matching types) if you would rather not hand-roll the union:

```ts
import { DynamicStringSchema } from "@copilotkit/a2ui-renderer";
```

```typescript
// src/app/demos/a2ui-fixed-schema/a2ui/definitions.ts
import { z } from "zod";
import type { CatalogDefinitions } from "@copilotkit/a2ui-renderer";

/**
 * Dynamic string: literal OR a data-model path binding. The GenericBinder
 * resolves path bindings to the actual value at render time.
 */
const DynString = z.union([z.string(), z.object({ path: z.string() })]);

export const definitions = {
  /**
   * Card override: gives the outer flight-card container a ShadCN look
   * (rounded-xl, neutral-200 border, soft shadow). The basic catalog's
   * Card uses inline styles; overriding here lets the demo's renderer
   * adopt the demo's Tailwind aesthetic without touching the schema JSON.
   */
  Card: {
    description: "A container card with a single child.",
    props: z.object({
      child: z.string(),
    }),
  },
  Title: {
    description: "A prominent heading for the flight card.",
    props: z.object({
      text: DynString,
    }),
  },
  Airport: {
    description: "A 3-letter airport code, displayed large.",
    props: z.object({
      code: DynString,
    }),
  },
  Arrow: {
    description: "A right-pointing arrow used between airports.",
    props: z.object({}),
  },
  AirlineBadge: {
    description: "A pill-styled airline name tag.",
    props: z.object({
      name: DynString,
    }),
  },
  PriceTag: {
    description: "A stylized price display (e.g. '$289').",
    props: z.object({
      amount: DynString,
    }),
  },

   * looks unchanged. Mirrors the pattern in beautiful-chat
   * (src/app/demos/beautiful-chat/declarative-generative-ui/renderers.tsx).
   */
  Button: {
    description:
      "An interactive button with an action event. Use 'child' with a Text component ID for the label. After click, the button shows a confirmation state.",
    props: z.object({
      child: z
        .string()
        .describe(
          "The ID of the child component (e.g. a Text component for the label).",
        ),
      variant: z.enum(["primary", "secondary", "ghost"]).optional(),
      // Union with { event } so GenericBinder resolves this as ACTION → callable () => void.
      action: z
        .union([
          z.object({
            event: z.object({
              name: z.string(),
              context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),
            }),
          }),
          z.null(),
        ])
        .optional(),
    }),
  },
} satisfies CatalogDefinitions;
```

### Implement the React renderers

TypeScript enforces that the renderer map's keys and prop shapes
match the definitions exactly, so refactors stay safe:

```typescript
// src/app/demos/a2ui-fixed-schema/a2ui/renderers.tsx
export const renderers: CatalogRenderers<Definitions> = {
  /**
   * Card override: ShadCN-style outer container. The basic catalog's Card
   * uses inline styles; overriding here keeps the demo's tailwind aesthetic.
   * The flight schema renders Card > Column > [Title, Row, …]; the inner
   * Column adds the vertical spacing.
   */
  Card: ({ props, children }) => (
    <Card className="w-full max-w-md p-5" data-testid="a2ui-fixed-card">
      {props.child ? children(props.child) : null}
    </Card>
  ),
  Title: ({ props }) => (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
      <div className="space-y-1">
        <p className="text-[11px] font-medium uppercase tracking-[0.14em] text-neutral-500">
          Itinerary
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight text-neutral-900">
          {s(props.text)}
        </h3>
      </div>
      <Badge variant="outline" className="font-mono">
        1-stop · economy
      </Badge>
    </div>
  ),
  Airport: ({ props }) => (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
      <span className="font-mono text-2xl font-semibold tracking-wider text-neutral-900">
        {s(props.code)}
      </span>
    </div>
  ),
  Arrow: () => (
    <div className="flex flex-1 items-center px-3">
      <Separator className="flex-1 bg-neutral-200" />
      <svg
        width="16"
        height="16"
        viewBox="0 0 24 24"
        fill="none"
        stroke="currentColor"
        strokeWidth="2"
        strokeLinecap="round"
        strokeLinejoin="round"
        className="mx-1 text-neutral-400"
        aria-hidden
      >
        <line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12" />
        <polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19" />
      </svg>
      <Separator className="flex-1 bg-neutral-200" />
    </div>
  ),
  AirlineBadge: ({ props }) => (
    <Badge variant="secondary" className="uppercase tracking-[0.08em]">
      {s(props.name)}
    </Badge>
  ),
  PriceTag: ({ props }) => (
    <div className="flex items-baseline gap-1">
      <span className="text-[11px] font-medium uppercase tracking-[0.14em] text-neutral-500">
        Total
      </span>
      <span className="font-mono text-base font-semibold text-neutral-900">
        {s(props.amount)}
      </span>
    </div>
  ),
  /**
   * Button override: this is a pure-presentation demo, so the button just
   * renders its label. The schema declares an `action` for visual fidelity,
   * but the click handler is inert until the Python SDK exposes
   * `action_handlers=` on `a2ui.render` (see `src/agents/a2ui_fixed.py`).
   */
  Button: ({ props, children }) => (
    <UIButton className="w-full">
      {props.child ? children(props.child) : null}
    </UIButton>
  ),
};
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Wire the catalog

`createCatalog(..., { includeBasicCatalog: true })` merges the custom
renderers with CopilotKit's built-ins so the schema can reference
`Card`, `Column`, `Row`, `Button` alongside the domain primitives:

```typescript
// src/app/demos/a2ui-fixed-schema/a2ui/catalog.ts
import { createCatalog } from "@copilotkit/a2ui-renderer";

import { definitions } from "./definitions";
import { renderers } from "./renderers";

export const CATALOG_ID = "copilotkit://flight-fixed-catalog";

export const catalog = createCatalog(definitions, renderers, {
  catalogId: CATALOG_ID,
  includeBasicCatalog: true,
});
```
</Step>


<Step>
### Load the schema JSON at startup

`a2ui.load_schema(path)` (or the framework's equivalent thin `json.load`
wrapper) parses the schema file once at module-import time. The
sibling `booked_schema.json` is kept ready for the button-click
"booked" optimistic swap (see the note on action handlers below):

```python
# src/agents/a2ui_fixed.py
_SCHEMAS_DIR = Path(__file__).parent / "a2ui_schemas"


def _load_schema(filename: str) -> list[dict]:
    with open(_SCHEMAS_DIR / filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as fh:
        return json.load(fh)


FLIGHT_SCHEMA = _load_schema("flight_schema.json")
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Return render operations from the tool

The agent tool returns `a2ui.render(operations=[…])`. The A2UI
middleware detects the operations container in the tool result and
forwards it to the frontend renderer. The LLM only generates the four
data fields (`origin`, `destination`, `airline`, `price`); the schema
does the rest:

```python
# src/agents/a2ui_fixed.py
_SCHEMAS_DIR = Path(__file__).parent / "a2ui_schemas"


def _load_schema(filename: str) -> list[dict]:
    with open(_SCHEMAS_DIR / filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as fh:
        return json.load(fh)


FLIGHT_SCHEMA = _load_schema("flight_schema.json")


SYSTEM_PROMPT = dedent("""
    You help users find flights. When asked about a flight, call
    `display_flight` with origin (3-letter code), destination (3-letter
    code), airline, and price (e.g. '$289'). Keep any chat reply to one
    short sentence.

                "version": "v0.9",
                "updateDataModel": {
                    "surfaceId": SURFACE_ID,

                },
            },
        ]
    }


```

Nothing about A2UI depends on how the agent itself is built — the operations
container is just the tool's return value, so the tool drops into whatever agent
you already have.
</Step>







</Steps>

## Why compositional beats monolithic

A single big `FlightCard` component would be faster to write but would
lock the design in place. Assembling the card from Card / Column /
Row / Title / Airport / Arrow / AirlineBadge / PriceTag gives you:

- **Reusable primitives** the same `Airport` renderer works in
  search results, booking confirmations, and future seat maps.
- **Schema-level design iteration** re-arranging rows or swapping a
  badge requires only a JSON edit; the renderer code is untouched.
- **A2UI Composer compatibility** hand-written and Composer-built
  schemas share the same primitive vocabulary.

## Registering the runtime

Your agent owns the tool in the fixed-schema approach, so you do not
want the runtime to inject its own. Enable A2UI but turn injection off.

Passing a catalog on the provider is enough to enable A2UI:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
<CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" a2ui={{ catalog: myCatalog }}>
  {children}
</CopilotKit>
```

Because a catalog auto-injects the A2UI tool by default, set
`injectA2UITool: false` on the runtime so your agent's own tool is the
only one in play. The middleware still auto-detects the operations the
tool returns and renders the surface, with no subagent involved:

```typescript title="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: { "a2ui-fixed-schema": agent },
  a2ui: { injectA2UITool: false, agents: ["a2ui-fixed-schema"] },
});
```

<!-- setup skipped: a2ui-fixed-schema-setup is not bundled for claude-sdk-python -->

## Action handlers (reference)

The canonical reference pairs fixed schemas with
`action_handlers={...}` to declare optimistic UI swaps (e.g. replacing
the flight schema with `BOOKED_SCHEMA` when the user clicks "Book").
The Python SDK's `a2ui.render` does not yet accept `action_handlers`,
so the cell omits them; the `booked_schema.json` sibling is retained
so the swap can be wired up the moment the SDK exposes the handler
kwarg.

When available, a button declares its action like this:

```json
{
  "Button": {
    "label": "Book",
    "action": {
      "name": "book_flight",
      "context": [
        { "key": "flightNumber", "value": { "path": "/flightNumber" } },
        { "key": "price", "value": { "path": "/price" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

And the Python tool matches it with a handler keyed by the action
name (plus a `"*"` catch-all). Until the SDK lands, handle the click on the
frontend instead — see
[Advanced — Action Handlers](./advanced#action-handlers) for the
`createA2UIMessageRenderer` / `onAction` pattern.

## When should I use fixed schemas?

- The surface is well-known: flight cards, product tiles, order
  summaries, dashboards.
- You want deterministic, designer-controlled UI. No LLM schema drift.
- You want the fastest possible first paint; no secondary LLM call.

If the UI must adapt per prompt, reach for
**[dynamic schemas](./dynamic-schema)** instead.
