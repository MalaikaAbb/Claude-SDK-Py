# Components as Tools

> Let your agent render rich React components directly in the chat by calling them as tools.


<!-- interactive demo: gen-ui-tool-based -->


## What is this?

Tool-based Generative UI is the simplest form of Generative UI: you register
a React component with `useComponent`, and CopilotKit exposes it to the
agent as a tool. When the agent calls the tool, CopilotKit renders your
component inline in the chat, passing the tool's arguments straight through
as typed props.

Unlike [tool rendering](/claude-sdk-python/generative-ui/tool-rendering), which wraps a
real backend tool in a custom UI, tool-based GenUI is the component. There
is no handler, no user interaction, no server-side execution. The agent
decides when to show it, populates the data, and CopilotKit paints it.

## When should I use this?

Use `useComponent` when you want to:

- Display rich UI (cards, charts, tables, dashboards) inline in the chat
- Show structured data the agent has derived from its reasoning
- Render previews, status indicators, or visual summaries
- Let the agent present information beyond plain text

For components that need user interaction, see
[Human-in-the-loop](/claude-sdk-python/human-in-the-loop). For operational transparency
around a real backend tool, see [Tool rendering](/claude-sdk-python/generative-ui/tool-rendering).

## How it works in code

    ### Forward browser tools to Claude

    Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` arrive in the AG-UI run
    input. Convert each AG-UI tool definition into an Anthropic Messages API
    tool schema before calling the model. Runs that carry frontend tools use
    the direct Messages API path rather than the Claude Agent SDK.

    
~~~~python title="agent.py"
def _build_frontend_tools(input_data: RunAgentInput) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Extract frontend-defined tools from the AG-UI request.

    The CopilotKit runtime forwards frontend tool definitions (registered
    via ``useFrontendTool``, ``useHumanInTheLoop``, etc.) in
    ``input_data.tools``. We convert them to the Anthropic ``tools``
    schema so the LLM can call them. The runtime intercepts the resulting
    tool-call events and routes them to the frontend for resolution.
    """
    out: list[dict[str, Any]] = []
    for t in input_data.tools or []:
        name = getattr(t, "name", None) or (
            t.get("name") if isinstance(t, dict) else None
        )
        description = getattr(t, "description", None) or (
            t.get("description", "") if isinstance(t, dict) else ""
        )
        parameters = getattr(t, "parameters", None) or (
            t.get("parameters", {}) if isinstance(t, dict) else {}
        )
        if not name:
            continue
# [!code highlight:7]
        out.append(
            {
                "name": name,
                "description": description or "",
                "input_schema": parameters or {"type": "object", "properties": {}},
            }
        )
    return out

`useComponent` takes a name, a Zod schema for its props, and the component
to render. The runtime registers it as a frontend tool so the agent can
discover it, and Zod validates the LLM's arguments before they reach your
component.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/gen-ui-tool-based/page.tsx
  useComponent({
    name: "render_bar_chart",
    description: "Display a bar chart with labeled numeric values.",
    parameters: barChartPropsSchema,
    render: BarChart,
  });
```

The component itself is ordinary React: it reads only its props and can
stream in as the agent fills the payload. The example above uses
[Recharts](https://recharts.org) for the bar chart; it doesn't know
anything about CopilotKit.

<Callout type="info">
  The `name` you pass to `useComponent` is what the agent sees as the tool
  name. Make it a verb like `render_bar_chart` or `show_weather` so the LLM
  reliably picks it when the user asks for that visualization.
