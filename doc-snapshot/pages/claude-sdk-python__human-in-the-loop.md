## What is this?

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) lets an agent pause mid-run to collect input,
confirmation, or a choice from the user, then resume with that answer
folded back into its reasoning. It's what turns an autonomous workflow
into a collaborative one: the agent keeps its context, the user keeps
the steering wheel.

## When should I use this?

Use HITL when you need:

- **Quality control** — a human gate at high-stakes decision points
- **Edge cases** — graceful fallbacks when the agent's confidence is low
- **Expert input** — lean on the user for domain knowledge the model lacks
- **Reliability** — a more robust loop for real-world, production traffic

## Two patterns for HITL in CopilotKit

<Steps>

    ### Model approvals as async frontend tools

    Claude Agent SDK human-in-the-loop demos use CopilotKit's promise-based
    frontend tool flow. The agent calls an approval tool, the UI resolves the
    tool result after the user decides, and the same Claude run continues with
    that result. Register the approval UI from the page component.

    
~~~~typescript title="page.tsx - useHumanInTheLoop"
  useHumanInTheLoop({
    agentId: "hitl-in-chat",
    name: "book_call",
    description:
      "Ask the user to pick a time slot for a call. The picker UI presents fixed candidate slots; the user's choice is returned to the agent.",
    parameters: z.object({
      topic: z
        .string()
        .describe("What the call is about (e.g. 'Intro with sales')"),
      attendee: z
        .string()
        .describe("Who the call is with (e.g. 'Alice from Sales')"),
    }),
    render: ({ args, status, respond }: any) => (
      <TimePickerCard
        topic={args?.topic ?? "a call"}
        attendee={args?.attendee}
        slots={slots}
        status={status}
        onSubmit={(result) => respond?.(result)}
      />
    ),
  });
~~~~

  </Step>
</Steps>

CopilotKit ships two complementary ways to pause an agent turn and ask
the human something. They look similar from the outside (the chat
pauses, a custom component appears, the user answers, the run resumes)
but they're wired differently on the backend, and each has its own niche.

| Pattern | Who decides to pause? | Backend surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useHumanInTheLoop` | The **LLM**, by calling a registered client-side tool | A frontend-only tool description (Zod schema + `render`) |
| `useInterrupt` | The **graph**, by calling `interrupt(...)` during a node | A server-side `interrupt()` call in your LangGraph agent |

**Pick `useHumanInTheLoop`** when the pause is an _agent-initiated_
decision — the model chose to ask the user — and you want the picker UI
inlined into the normal tool-call flow.

**Pick `useInterrupt`** when the pause is a _graph-enforced_ checkpoint —
the code path deterministically requires a human answer — and you want
`langgraph.interrupt()` as the server-side contract.

## Pattern 1 — `useHumanInTheLoop` (tool-based)

The agent registers a HITL tool on the client with `useHumanInTheLoop`.
When the LLM calls that tool, CopilotKit routes the call through your
`render` function, which shows a custom component and calls `respond`
with the user's answer. The agent sees the answer as the tool result and
continues from there.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/hitl-in-chat/page.tsx
import React, { useMemo } from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotChat,
  useHumanInTheLoop,
  useConfigureSuggestions,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
import type { TimeSlot } from "./time-picker-card";
import { TimePickerCard } from "./time-picker-card";

function buildDefaultSlots(now = new Date()): TimeSlot[] {
  const tomorrow = new Date(now);
  tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);

  const monday = new Date(now);
  const daysUntilMonday = (8 - monday.getDay()) % 7 || 7;
  monday.setDate(monday.getDate() + daysUntilMonday);

  return [
    buildSlot(tomorrow, "Tomorrow", 10, 0),
    buildSlot(tomorrow, "Tomorrow", 14, 0),
    buildSlot(monday, "Monday", 9, 0),
    buildSlot(monday, "Monday", 15, 30),
  ];
}

function buildSlot(
  date: Date,
  labelPrefix: string,
  hour: number,
  minute: number,
): TimeSlot {
  const slotDate = new Date(date);
  slotDate.setHours(hour, minute, 0, 0);
  return {
    label: `${labelPrefix} ${formatTime(slotDate)}`,
    iso: slotDate.toISOString(),
  };
}

function formatTime(date: Date): string {
  return date.toLocaleTimeString([], {
    hour: "numeric",
    minute: "2-digit",
  });
}

export default function HitlInChatDemo() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="hitl-in-chat">
      <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen w-full">
        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-4xl">
          <Chat />
        </div>
      </div>
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}

function Chat() {
  const slots = useMemo(() => buildDefaultSlots(), []);

  useConfigureSuggestions({
    suggestions: [
      {
        title: "Book a call with sales",
        message:
          "Please book an intro call with the sales team to discuss pricing.",
      },
      {
        title: "Schedule a 1:1 with Alice",
        message: "Schedule a 1:1 with Alice next week to review Q2 goals.",
      },
    ],
    available: "always",
  });

  useHumanInTheLoop({
    agentId: "hitl-in-chat",
    name: "book_call",
    description:
      "Ask the user to pick a time slot for a call. The picker UI presents fixed candidate slots; the user's choice is returned to the agent.",
    parameters: z.object({
      topic: z
        .string()
        .describe("What the call is about (e.g. 'Intro with sales')"),
      attendee: z
        .string()
        .describe("Who the call is with (e.g. 'Alice from Sales')"),
    }),
    render: ({ args, status, respond }: any) => (
      <TimePickerCard
        topic={args?.topic ?? "a call"}
        attendee={args?.attendee}
        slots={slots}
        status={status}
        onSubmit={(result) => respond?.(result)}
      />
    ),
  });
```

The picker UI is fed a static list of candidate slots — this is just
data the demo page owns, so you can swap in real availability, a
calendar API, or anything else:

```typescript
// src/app/demos/hitl-in-chat/page.tsx
import React, { useMemo } from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotChat,
  useHumanInTheLoop,
  useConfigureSuggestions,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
import type { TimeSlot } from "./time-picker-card";
import { TimePickerCard } from "./time-picker-card";

function buildDefaultSlots(now = new Date()): TimeSlot[] {
  const tomorrow = new Date(now);
  tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);

  const monday = new Date(now);
  const daysUntilMonday = (8 - monday.getDay()) % 7 || 7;
  monday.setDate(monday.getDate() + daysUntilMonday);

  return [
    buildSlot(tomorrow, "Tomorrow", 10, 0),
    buildSlot(tomorrow, "Tomorrow", 14, 0),
    buildSlot(monday, "Monday", 9, 0),
    buildSlot(monday, "Monday", 15, 30),
  ];
}

function buildSlot(
  date: Date,
  labelPrefix: string,
  hour: number,
  minute: number,
): TimeSlot {
  const slotDate = new Date(date);
  slotDate.setHours(hour, minute, 0, 0);
  return {
    label: `${labelPrefix} ${formatTime(slotDate)}`,
    iso: slotDate.toISOString(),
  };
}

function formatTime(date: Date): string {
  return date.toLocaleTimeString([], {
    hour: "numeric",
    minute: "2-digit",
  });
}
```

## Pattern 2 — `useInterrupt` (graph-paused)

With LangGraph's `interrupt()` the pause is enforced by the graph
itself: a node calls `interrupt({...})`, the run suspends, the client
receives the payload, renders a UI, and resumes the run with the user's
answer. CopilotKit's `useInterrupt` hook is the render contract.

See the [`useInterrupt` deep dive](/claude-sdk-python/human-in-the-loop/useInterrupt) for
the full walkthrough, including the backend tool and render-prop wiring.

## Going headless

Both patterns above ship with a `render` prop — CopilotKit handles the
"when to show the picker" logic for you. If you want to drive
interrupt resolution from a custom UI that lives anywhere in the tree
(not necessarily inside a chat), see the
[headless interrupts guide](/claude-sdk-python/human-in-the-loop/headless) — it shows
how to compose `useAgent`, `agent.subscribe`, and `copilotkit.runAgent`
to build your own `useInterrupt` equivalent.
