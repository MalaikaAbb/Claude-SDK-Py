# CopilotPopup

> Floating chat bubble that toggles open an overlay chat window.


<!-- interactive demo: prebuilt-popup -->


## What is this?

`<CopilotPopup>` is a prebuilt floating launcher that opens an overlay chat
window on top of your page content. It's the lightest-weight way to add a
copilot to an existing app. Drop it in once and a bubble appears in the
corner ready to chat.

## When should I use this?

Use the popup when you want:

- A minimal-footprint copilot that overlays existing content on demand
- A launcher you can place on top of any page without reflowing the layout
- A quick assistant bubble that users open for short, task-focused chats

If you need chat to live alongside your content rather than on top of it,
use [CopilotSidebar](/claude-sdk-python/prebuilt-components/sidebar). For a fully embedded
chat pane, use [`<CopilotChat>`](/claude-sdk-python/prebuilt-components/chat) directly.

## Basic setup

Wrap your app in `<CopilotKit>` once (the provider wires the runtime,
session, and agent registry) and render `<CopilotPopup>` as a sibling of
your main content. The example below opens the popup by default and
customizes the input placeholder via `labels`:

```typescript
// src/app/demos/prebuilt-popup/page.tsx
    <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="prebuilt-popup">
      <MainContent />
      <CopilotPopup
        agentId="prebuilt-popup"
        defaultOpen={true}
        labels={{
          chatInputPlaceholder: "Ask the popup anything...",
        }}
      />
      <Suggestions />
    </CopilotKit>
```

## Configuring the popup

`<CopilotPopup>` accepts the same props as `<CopilotChat>` plus a few of
its own. Commonly used options:

| Prop | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `defaultOpen` | Whether the popup starts open on first render. |
| `agentId` | Agent slug the popup should talk to (must match an agent configured on the runtime). |
| `labels` | User-facing copy for the header, placeholder, and disclaimer. |
| `header` | Slot for the popup header bar — see the [slot system](/claude-sdk-python/custom-look-and-feel/slots). |
| `toggleButton` | Slot for the floating launcher button. |

## Styling

`CopilotPopup` participates in the slot system, so every piece of its UI
is customizable, from Tailwind classes on the message view to a full
component swap for the header or toggle button. See
[custom look and feel](/claude-sdk-python/custom-look-and-feel/slots) for the full slot
reference.
