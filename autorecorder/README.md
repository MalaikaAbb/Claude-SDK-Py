# Autorecorder

Automated screen-recording suite for CopilotKit framework integrations. It
produces one narrated-looking demo video per documentation page: read the doc,
switch to VS Code and show the code that implements it, switch to the browser and
drive the live feature.

Currently configured for **Claude Agent SDK (Python) + React** — the 26 routes of
this repo that have a chrome-free `demo-chat` page. The remaining doc routes are
reference pages with nothing to drive; see *Scope* below.

> **Porting this to another framework?** Read **[ADAPT.md](ADAPT.md)** first. It
> is written for the person or agent doing the port, and it is the contract the
> `doctor` command enforces.

## Run it

Both services must be up first — the recorder refuses to start otherwise, because
a video of a dead page is worse than no video.

```bash
cd backend && uv run python src/agent_server.py     # http://localhost:8000
cd frontend && npm run dev                           # :3000
```

Both default ports are assumed. If something else already owns them, start this
stack elsewhere and point the recorder at it — every URL derives from these:

```bash
# start the agent server on a spare port, and the app on another
PORT=3001 npm run dev

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001 BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001 npm run doctor:online
```

Then:

```bash
cd autorecorder
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

npm run doctor            # is the configuration sane?
npm run record -- --list  # what will be recorded
npm run record -- --quickstart
npm run record            # all pages, in order
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--list`, `--help` | Print every registered route and exit |
| `--doctor` | Validate the configuration; exits 1 on error |
| `--doctor --online` | Also probe every doc/demo URL and the selectors |
| `--<page-id>` | Record one page — `--quickstart`, `--slots` |
| `--page=<id>` | Same thing, explicit form |
| `--filter=<query>` | Record every page whose id or name contains the query |
| `--force` | Record even if the pre-flight health check fails |

Videos land in `videos/` as `CLAUDESDK-PY-react-<NN>-<name>.webm`, 1920×1080, ~25fps
(Playwright's capture rate; it is not configurable).

**`videos/` is gitignored on purpose.** Recordings are build output — reproducible
from this folder plus `npm run record` — and committing them is expensive: 17 clips
at ~5MB, rewritten on every re-record, took one repo's `.git` to 348MB before its
history had to be rewritten. Publish them as release assets or to a bucket. Keep
this policy when you copy the folder into another repo.

## Scope in this repo

A page is recordable only if it has something to drive, and the recorder reaches
every demo at `<route>/demo-chat`. This app tracks 28 doc routes; the 2 that carry no
`demo-chat` page are reference material and are deliberately **not** registered.

Registering one anyway would fail `doctor --online`, because `demoUrl` is always
`route + demoSuffix` and there is no per-page way to say "this one has no demo".
That is a gap in `core/`, not something to work around here — see ADAPT.md.

**This list is derived, not hand-written.** `config/pages.config.ts` is generated
from `frontend/src/lib/nav-config.ts` — the app's own source of truth for route →
doc-page mapping — so the recorder cannot drift from the nav. Re-derive it when the
nav changes, then re-check the line ranges.

**Most pages use `runStandardAction`.** A specialised handler is wired only where
this repo's demo page actually contains the DOM that handler drives. Pages that
look similar but render differently are left on the standard action rather than
wired optimistically — see the note at the top of `actions/index.ts`.

## Tracking recordings

Clips are **not** in git, and every run overwrites the same 16 filenames in place
— so nothing about the files themselves says which are fresh. `npm run manifest`
is what closes that gap:

```bash
npm run record            # produces the clips
npm run manifest          # records their state — run this straight after
```

It writes two committed files next to the (uncommitted) videos:

| File | For |
|---|---|
| `videos/manifest.json` | source of truth — per clip: mtime, size, sha256, the source files it shows, and a hash of those files plus the page definition |
| `videos/MANIFEST.md` | the same thing as a table, readable on GitHub |

Commit both. **The diff on those files is the record of what a run changed** —
that is the whole mechanism. Together they are ~12KB, against ~84MB of video.

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| ✅ current | clip matches the code it shows |
| 🆕 new | the clip changed since the last manifest — this run re-recorded it |
| ⚠️ stale | a source file was modified *after* the clip was recorded |
| ⚠️ drifted | mtimes look fine but the source content hash moved (mtimes all reset on a fresh clone, which hides staleness — this catches it) |
| ❌ missing | a registered page with no clip on disk |

A clip is judged against the files it actually puts on screen — its `ideFile` and
any `extraTabs` — plus its own page definition, so changing a prompt or a
highlighted line range marks it stale exactly as an edit to the code does.

`npm run manifest:check` prints without writing and exits 1 if anything is stale
or missing, which is the form to put in CI.

**What it does not tell you: whether the run passed.** Playwright saves the video
even when a page fails, so a clip from a failed run still looks current. Freshness
and correctness are different questions — the run summary answers the second one.

## Reading the summary

```
   ✅ [PASS]  (24.1s) Quickstart -> MSPY-react-01-Quickstart.webm
   ⚠️  [PASS*] (31.7s) Inspector -> MSPY-react-06-Inspector.webm
        · Doc page (…/inspector): Timeout 25000ms exceeded
   ❌ [FAIL]  (19.4s) AG-UI -> MSPY-react-17-AgUi.webm
        · Demo step failed: Agent never produced a response within 30s
```

- **PASS** — every step completed.
- **PASS\*** — recorded, but the external doc page misbehaved. The intro footage
  is degraded; the feature under test is not implicated.
- **FAIL** — the demo route 404'd, never rendered a chat surface, the agent never
  answered, or the IDE view could not be built. The process exits 1, so this is
  safe to gate CI on.

Every framework-specific value lives in `config/`. If something in `core/` needs
to change for a port, that is a bug in this folder — see ADAPT.md.

## What a recording actually does

1. **Doc page** — opens the real documentation URL, waits for hydration, then
   scrolls at reading pace and rests the cursor on a code block. Clicks VS Code
   on the simulated taskbar.
2. **IDE** — renders the project's own source, read from disk and highlighted
   with Shiki, with the page's line range selected. Multi-tab pages switch tabs.
   Served from the frontend's origin via an intercepted route, so the doc page is
   fully unloaded rather than painted over. Clicks Chrome on the taskbar.
3. **Demo** — opens the chrome-free demo route, waits for it to be genuinely
   ready, types the prompt, waits for the reply to finish streaming, and pauses
   for reading.

Two details worth knowing, because both were bugs once:

- Overlays are injected as children of `<html>`, which React owns on any App
  Router page. `ensureOverlays` installs a MutationObserver that re-attaches them
  if a render pass deletes them, and step 1 waits for hydration before scrolling
  so a remount cannot snap the page back to the top.
- Playwright starts recording when the page is created, so the first navigation
  is dead footage. The doc URL is warmed in a throwaway page first, which cuts
  it roughly in half; removing the rest would need an ffmpeg trim in post.
- A dev server serves markup before it serves behaviour. "The route responded"
  and "the chat works" are different claims: client chunks compile lazily, and
  API routes compile on their *first request* — which would otherwise be the
  prompt. `actions/page-ready.ts` waits for the document to finish, the DOM to
  stop changing, the input to be genuinely enabled, and `runtimeWarmPath` to be
  built, before any handler types anything. Without it a cold route produces a
  video of a prompt that was never really sent.

## Troubleshooting

**`Aborting before launching a browser`** — a service is down. The message names
which one and the command to start it. `--force` overrides.

**A page fails with "Agent never produced a response within 30s"** — either the
demo is genuinely broken, or `selectors.config.ts → assistantMessage` does not
match this app's messages. Run `npm run doctor --online` to tell the two apart.

**The IDE highlights the wrong lines** — the line range drifted. `npm run doctor`
names the file and where its markers actually are now.

**A page fails only on the first run after starting the dev server** — it was
still compiling. The readiness gate absorbs this (it will log
`agent endpoint compiled in Ns` when it did real work), but the *agent's* own
cold start is separate: the first model call after starting the backend can take
~60s, which is longer than the 30s response window. Send one message by hand, or
record a single page, before running the full suite.

**A recording passes but the video is wrong** — the doctor cannot see cursor
placement or highlight correctness. Watch it.
