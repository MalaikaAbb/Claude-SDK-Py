 * What the recorder *does* on each demo page once it is open.
 *
 * The registry lives here rather than in `core/` on purpose: adding or removing
 * a page must never mean editing frozen code. A page with no entry falls back
 * to `runStandardAction` — type the prompt, submit, wait for the reply — which
 * is right for most pages. Write a handler only when a page needs more than
 * that: switching tabs, clicking an approval button, opening a panel.
 *
 * ── How this map was built ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A specialised handler is wired only where this repo's demo page actually
 * contains the DOM that handler drives — the tab labels it clicks, the
 * placeholder it types into, the button it presses. Pages that look similar but
 * render differently are deliberately left on `runStandardAction` rather than
 * wired optimistically, because a handler pointed at the wrong DOM fails the
 * run. Unwired handler files are kept: they are the closest starting point when
 * one of those pages does need driving.
 *
 * Handlers should build on the helpers in `core/actions.ts`:
 *
 *   sendPrompt(page, prompt, opts)          types and submits, returns the
 *                                           assistant-message count from before
 *                                           submitting
 *   waitForAgentResponseCompletion(...)     waits for the reply to finish, and
 *                                           throws if none ever arrives
 *   promptsFor(config)                      the page's prompts[] , or [prompt]
 *
 * Pass that returned count into waitForAgentResponseCompletion on multi-turn
 * pages, or the previous turn's reply is mistaken for this one's.
