/**
 * Recording manifest — what is on disk, when it was made, and whether it still
 * matches the code it shows.
 *
 * The clips themselves are deliberately not in git (see `videos/.gitignore`):
 * 16 files x ~5MB rewritten on every run is not something version control should
 * carry. But that leaves no way to tell a clip recorded five minutes ago from one
 * recorded last month against a UI that has since changed, because every run
 * overwrites the same filenames in place.
 *
 * So the binaries stay out and this stays in: a small committed file recording,
 * per clip, when it was made, what it hashes to, and the state of the source
 * files it puts on screen. `git diff` on the manifest then shows exactly what a
 * run changed, and a stale clip announces itself instead of being discovered by
 * someone watching a video of code that no longer exists.
 *
 *   npm run manifest         rewrite manifest.json + MANIFEST.md, print the table
 *   npm run manifest:check   print only; exit 1 if anything is missing or stale
 *
 * Run it right after `npm run record` — that is what makes the recorded source
 * hash mean "the source as it was when this clip was made".
 *
 * ── Why this is a sibling of cli.ts rather than a flag on it ────────────────
 * `package.json` already shipped `"manifest": "tsx cli.ts --manifest"`, but
 * `cli.ts` never implemented `--manifest` and does not list it in GLOBAL_FLAGS,
 * so that script fell through to the page-name filter, matched nothing and
 * exited 1. `cli.ts` is frozen by ADAPT.md, so the feature lands here and the
 * script now points at this file. The dangling flag is worth reporting upstream.
