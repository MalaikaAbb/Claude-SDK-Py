/**
 * One provider for the whole app, so a conversation survives navigation
 * between test routes.
 *
 * Three routes mount a second, nested `<CopilotKit>` of their own rather than
 * using this one — Voice (its own runtime, because `transcriptionService` only
 * exists on the v2 runtime handler) and the two A2UI routes (each needs its
 * own catalog on the provider, and the doc pages pass it there). Those are the
 * cases where the doc page is specifically about the provider, so an isolated
 * instance is the honest thing to show.
 *
 * On the inspector prop name, which is genuinely confusing: the doc page says
 * `enableInspector`, and that prop exists — but only on `<CopilotKit>`, the v1
 * compatibility wrapper. All it does there is forward to this provider's
 * `showDevConsole`. On `CopilotKitProvider` there is no `enableInspector` at
 * all, and `showDevConsole` is the only switch. See README §9.
