/**
 * The doc's whole integration: a drawer and a chat inside one shared
 * `CopilotChatConfigurationProvider`.
 *
 * The shared configuration is the point. It holds the active thread, so
 * selecting a row connects the chat to that thread and replays its history, and
 * the "New Conversation" row resets the chat to a fresh welcome screen — with
 * no `threadId` state, no selection handler, and no props passed between the
 * two components.
 *
 * `CopilotKitProvider` is not repeated here; the app already mounts one at the
 * root. The doc nests them because its sample is a whole page, and its sample
 * also passes `publicLicenseKey` on that provider — this repo sets the licence
 * on the runtime instead, so the key never reaches the browser bundle.
 *
 * One departure, presentational only. The doc's wrapper is
 * `<div style={{ display: "flex", height: "100dvh" }}>` with the two components
 * as bare children. In a flex row `CopilotChat` has no flex basis of its own,
 * so it collapses to min-content — the chat renders one word per line beside a
 * full-width drawer. `flex: 1` plus `minWidth: 0` gives it the remaining space;
 * `minWidth` matters because a flex item's default `min-width: auto` refuses to
 * shrink below its content and would push the layout wider than the viewport.
